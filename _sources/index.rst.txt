Installation
------------

To install the package, run:

.. code:: bash

    pip install reference_package

See https://pypi.org/project/reference-package/.


Library
-------

Avoid calling library functions directly and stick to the public API:

.. code:: python

    from reference_package import wait_a_second

    wait_a_second()

If you're a power user, you can use the internal API:

.. code:: python

    from reference_package.api.internal import wait_a_second

    wait_a_second()


Nothing is stopping you from importing from lib directly, but you should avoid it unless you're developing:

.. code:: python

    from reference_package.lib.example import wait_a_second

    wait_a_second()
