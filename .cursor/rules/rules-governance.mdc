# Rules Governance for Cursor Project Rules

## Purpose

This rule governs the creation, structure, and maintenance of all Cursor rules in this project. It ensures rules are actionable, maintainable, and follow Cursor's official best practices ([see docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules)).

## Rule Types

- **Project Rules**: Store in `.cursor/rules/`, version-controlled, scoped to the codebase or subdirectories.
- **User Rules**: Set in Cursor Settings → Rules, global to your environment.

## Rule Anatomy

- Write each rule in MDC (`.mdc`) format with YAML metadata at the top:
  - `description`: Brief summary of the rule's purpose.
  - `globs`: File patterns the rule applies to.
  - `alwaysApply`: true/false (controls if always included).
- Overall structure:
  - Start with YAML metadata block (description, globs, alwaysApply).
  - Follow with markdown content.
  - Keep focused and actionable.

- Use referenced files (e.g., `@template.ts`) for additional context if needed.

## Rule Types and Application

- **Always**: Always included in model context.
- **Auto Attached**: Included when files matching a glob pattern are referenced.
- **Agent Requested**: Available to AI, included as needed (must provide a description).
- **Manual**: Only included when explicitly mentioned using `@ruleName`.

## Directory Structure

- Place project-wide rules in `.cursor/rules/`.
- For subdirectory-specific rules, add `.cursor/rules/` in that subdirectory.
- Nested rules auto-attach when files in their directory are referenced.

## Best Practices

- Keep rules focused, actionable, and scoped.
- Keep rules under 500 lines.
- Split large rules into multiple, composable files.
- Provide concrete examples or referenced files.
- Avoid vague guidance; write rules like clear internal docs.
- Reuse rules when repeating prompts in chat.
- Use descriptive, concise metadata.

## Good vs. Bad Rules

### ✅ Good Rule:

- Focused scope (specific file patterns).
- Clear, actionable guidance.
- Descriptive metadata.
- Under 500 lines.

### ❌ Bad Rule:

- Vague, broad scope.
- Unclear guidance.
- Poor metadata.
- Too long or unfocused.

## Maintenance

- Review rules regularly for relevance and clarity.
- Remove or update outdated rules.
- Ensure metadata is accurate and globs are correct.

## FAQ

- If a rule isn't being applied, check its type and glob patterns.
- Reference other rules or files using `@filename`.
- Rules only apply to Agent and Inline Edit, not Cursor Tab.
