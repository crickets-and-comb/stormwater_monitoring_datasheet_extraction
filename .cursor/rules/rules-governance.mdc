# Rules Governance for Cursor Project Rules

## Purpose
This rule governs the creation, structure, and maintenance of all Cursor rules in this project. It ensures rules are actionable, maintainable, and follow Cursor's official best practices ([see docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules)).

## Rule Types
- **Project Rules**: Store in `.cursor/rules/`, version-controlled, scoped to the codebase or subdirectories.
- **User Rules**: Set in Cursor Settings â†’ Rules, global to your environment.
- **Legacy Rules**: `.cursorrules` in project root is deprecated; migrate to Project Rules.

## Rule Anatomy
- Write each rule in MDC (`.mdc`) format with YAML metadata at the top:
  - `description`: Brief summary of the rule's purpose
  - `globs`: File patterns the rule applies to
  - `alwaysApply`: true/false (controls if always included)
- Example:
  ```mdc
  ---
  description: Example rule
  globs: ["src/**/*.py"]
  alwaysApply: false
  ---
  
  # Example Rule
  - Use snake_case for all variable names.
  ```
- Use referenced files (e.g., `@template.ts`) for additional context if needed.

## Rule Types and Application
- **Always**: Always included in model context
- **Auto Attached**: Included when files matching a glob pattern are referenced
- **Agent Requested**: Available to AI, included as needed (must provide a description)
- **Manual**: Only included when explicitly mentioned using `@ruleName`

## Directory Structure
- Place project-wide rules in `.cursor/rules/`
- For subdirectory-specific rules, add `.cursor/rules/` in that subdirectory
- Nested rules auto-attach when files in their directory are referenced

## Best Practices
- Keep rules focused, actionable, and scoped
- Keep rules under 500 lines
- Split large rules into multiple, composable files
- Provide concrete examples or referenced files
- Avoid vague guidance; write rules like clear internal docs
- Reuse rules when repeating prompts in chat
- Use descriptive, concise metadata

## Maintenance
- Review rules regularly for relevance and clarity
- Remove or update outdated rules
- Ensure metadata is accurate and globs are correct
- Prefer project rules over legacy `.cursorrules`

## FAQ
- If a rule isn't being applied, check its type and glob patterns
- Reference other rules or files using `@filename`
- Rules only apply to Agent and Inline Edit, not Cursor Tab
