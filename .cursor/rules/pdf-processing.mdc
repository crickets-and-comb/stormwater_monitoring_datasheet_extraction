# PDF Processing Rules

## Computer Vision Standards

- Use OpenCV for image preprocessing.
- Implement proper error handling for corrupted images.
- Validate image quality before OCR processing.
- Handle various PDF formats and resolutions.

## OCR Processing

- Use Tesseract for text extraction.
- Preprocess images to improve OCR accuracy.
- Implement confidence scoring for extracted text.
- Provide fallback options for low-confidence results.

## Data Validation

- Validate extracted data against expected ranges.
- Handle missing or incomplete form fields.
- Implement data quality flags.
- Log processing errors for debugging.

## Performance Considerations

- Process large PDFs in chunks.
- Use efficient image processing algorithms.
- Cache processed results when appropriate.
- Monitor memory usage for large files.
- Cache processed results when appropriate.
- Monitor memory usage for large files.
