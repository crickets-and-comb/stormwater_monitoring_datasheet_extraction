# Contributor Guidelines

These rules summarize and enforce the project's contributor guidelines. For full details, see [.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## General Principles

- Read and follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- All pull requests (PRs) must be connected to an open issue. You may open an issue if one does not already exist for your issue.
- Only open a PR after explicit admin approval.
- Keep each issue/PR focused and limited in scope.
- Avoid sprawling PRs; small, focused changes are preferred.

## Bug Reports

- Provide a minimal reproducible example.
- Include environment details (OS, Python version, etc.).
- Attach the full stack trace and failing call.

## Pull Request Process

- Add/modify test coverage for all expected behavior (bug fixes and new features).
- Follow Git workflow defined in `git-workflow.mdc`.

## Code Quality Requirements

- Follow coding standards defined in `coding-standards.mdc`.
- Follow testing practices defined in `testing-practices.mdc`.
- Follow documentation standards defined in `documentation-standards.mdc` and `coding-standards.mdc`.

## Etiquette

- Be respectful and constructive in all communications.
- Collaborate with maintainers to refine requests and avoid duplicate work.
- Understand that workflow runs cost money; be considerate with PRs.
