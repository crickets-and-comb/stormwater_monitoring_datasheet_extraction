# Contributor Guidelines

These rules summarize and enforce the project's contributor guidelines. For full details, see [.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## General Principles

- Read and follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- All pull requests (PRs) must be connected to an open issue. You may open an issue if one does not already exist for your issue.
- Only open a PR after explicit admin approval.
- Keep each issue/PR focused and limited in scope.
- Avoid sprawling PRs; small, focused changes are preferred.

## Bug Reports

- Provide a minimal reproducible example.
- Include environment details (OS, Python version, etc.).
- Attach the full stack trace and failing call.

## Pull Request Process

- Add test coverage for all expected behavior (bug fixes and new features).
- Each function/method should do a discrete thing and/or wrap a set of discrete calls.
- Limit functions to <= 50 lines when possible.
- Functions should have a single exit point (one return statement), unless a clear exception is justified.
- Avoid externalities:
  - Functions should only modify objects within their own scope.
  - Use `typing.Final` for constants, and treat them as immutable.

## Code Quality Requirements

- Follow coding standards defined in `coding-standards.mdc`.
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful naming.
- Use docstrings for functions, classes, methods, and modules.
- Comments should provide context, not explain what code does.
- Copy edit all prose: spelling, grammar, fact check, link check.

## TODO Management

- Avoid leaving TODOs in code.
- All remaining TODOs should be tagged to an open issue.
- Link TODOs to specific GitHub issues when possible.
- Clean up TODOs when implementing features or fixes.

## Etiquette

- Be respectful and constructive in all communications.
- Collaborate with maintainers to refine requests and avoid duplicate work.
- Understand that workflow runs cost money; be considerate with PRs.

- For the full contributor guidelines, see [.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
