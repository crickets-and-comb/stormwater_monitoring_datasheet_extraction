# Project Planning Standards

## Strategic Planning

### Feature Prioritization

- Use MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).
- Consider business value, technical complexity, and user impact.
- Prioritize environmental data quality.
- Balance new features with technical debt reduction.

### Milestone Planning

- Break large features into 2-4 week milestones.
- Break milestones into issues and/or sub-issues that are estimated to take as little as 15 minutes each but no more than 5 days each.
- Include testing, review, and documentation time in estimates.

### Risk Assessment

- Identify technical risks early in planning.
- Consider data quality and compliance risks.
- Plan mitigation strategies for high-risk items.
- Document assumptions and dependencies.

## Technical Architecture Planning
