# Technical Design Standards

## Architecture Principles

### System Design

- Design for environmental data quality and integrity.
- Plan for regulatory compliance from the start.
- Consider data scalability and performance requirements.
- Design for maintainability and long-term support.
- Include security and privacy considerations.

### Data Architecture

- Design robust data models for environmental data.
- Plan for data validation and quality checks.
- Consider data lineage and provenance tracking.
- Include data backup and recovery procedures.

## API Design Standards

### RESTful API Design

- Use consistent naming conventions.
- Design for environmental data workflows.
- Include proper error handling and status codes.
- Plan for versioning and backward compatibility.
- Consider rate limiting and security measures.

### Data Exchange Formats

- Use standardized formats for environmental data.
- Include metadata for data quality and provenance.
- Plan for regulatory compliance reporting.
- Design for interoperability with other systems.
- Include validation schemas and documentation.

## Performance Considerations

### Data Processing Performance
