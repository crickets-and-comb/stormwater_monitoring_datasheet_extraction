# Security Practices

## Input Validation

- Validate all input data before processing.
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Enforce data types.
- Validate file uploads and check file types.
- Implement proper error handling for invalid inputs.

## Data Protection

- Handle sensitive environmental data appropriately.
- Use environment variables for API keys and secrets.
- Never hardcode credentials in source code.
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
- Implement proper access controls for data.

## Dependency Security

- Run `make clean security` to check for vulnerabilities.
- Keep dependencies updated and patched.
- Monitor for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## File Processing Security

- Validate files before processing.
- Check file size limits to prevent DoS attacks.
- Scan uploaded files for malicious content.
- Use secure file handling practices.
- Implement proper file cleanup.

## API Security

- Validate all API inputs and outputs.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization.
- Use HTTPS for all external communications.
- Rate limit API endpoints to prevent abuse.
- Log security-relevant events.

## Error Handling

- Don't expose sensitive information in error messages.
- Log errors appropriately for debugging.
- Use generic error messages for users.
- Implement proper exception handling.
- Avoid information leakage in stack traces.

## Code Quality Security

- Follow secure coding practices.
- Avoid common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
- Use parameterized queries for database operations.
- Implement proper input sanitization.
- Review code for security issues.

## Environmental Data Security

- Protect environmental monitoring data.
- Implement data retention policies.
- Secure data transmission and storage.
- Audit access to sensitive environmental data.

## Development Security

- Use secure development practices.
- Review code for security vulnerabilities.
- Test security controls regularly.
- Keep development tools updated.
- Use secure development environments.

## Monitoring & Logging

- Log security-relevant events.
- Monitor for suspicious activities.
- Implement proper audit trails.
- Use secure logging practices.
- Monitor system access and usage.

## Incident Response

- Have a plan for security incidents.
- Know how to report security issues.
- Document security procedures.
- Train team on security practices.
- Regular security reviews and updates.
